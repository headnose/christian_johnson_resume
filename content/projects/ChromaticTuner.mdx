**Chromatic Tuner** is a professional-grade iOS tuner application that delivers real-time pitch detection with studio-quality accuracy. Built entirely in SwiftUI with modern iOS development practices, the app provides musicians with precise tuning feedback through an intuitive, visually appealing interface.

## Demo

*App Store deployment planned for 2025*

## Features

- **Real-time Pitch Detection**: Â±1 cent accuracy using advanced audio processing
- **Chromatic Note Recognition**: Automatic detection across full chromatic scale with octave display
- **Visual Tuning Meter**: Custom-built cents meter with color-coded accuracy zones
- **Configurable Update Rates**: Adjustable detection frequency (1x to 3x speed)
- **Universal Instrument Support**: Works with guitar, violin, piano, brass, woodwinds, and more
- **Modern SwiftUI Interface**: Smooth animations and responsive design
- **Offline Functionality**: No internet connection required

## Technologies Used

- **Swift 5.9** / **SwiftUI**
- **AVFoundation** (Audio session management)
- **Combine Framework** (Reactive programming)
- **Tuna Library** (Pitch detection engine)
- **MVVM Architecture**
- **iOS 15.0+**

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- Clean MVVM pattern with reactive data binding
- Protocol-oriented design for testability
- Modular component structure ready for App Store deployment

### Audio Processing
```swift
// Configured AVAudioSession for optimal microphone input
try audioSession.setCategory(.record, mode: .measurement, options: [])

// Real-time pitch detection with delegate pattern
func pitchEngine(_ engine: PitchEngine, didReceive result: Result<Pitch, Error>)
```

### Music Theory Implementation
- Equal temperament calculations using A4=440Hz standard
- Logarithmic frequency-to-pitch conversion algorithms
- Precise cents deviation measurement (100 cents = 1 semitone)

### SwiftUI Components
- Custom `CentsMeterView` with geometric calculations
- Responsive layouts using `GeometryReader`
- `@Published` properties for automatic UI updates

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chromatic-tuner.git
   ```

2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd chromatic-tuner
   open ChromaticTuner.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   - Add Tuna library via Swift Package Manager
   - Build and run on iOS device (microphone access required)

## Key Challenges Solved

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Simulator fallback for testing without microphone
- **Audio session management**: Proper lifecycle handling and permission requests  
- **Mathematical precision**: Implemented equal temperament tuning calculations
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient timer management for battery life

## Code Quality

- Comprehensive error handling with `Result<Success, Error>` patterns
- Memory safety using `[weak self]` to prevent retain cycles
- Clean separation of concerns with single-responsibility components
- Extensive inline documentation and architectural comments

## Future Enhancements

- Instrument-specific presets (guitar, bass, violin tunings)
- Alternate temperament support (baroque, world music scales)
- Strobe tuner and analog needle display modes
- Settings panel for reference pitch customization
- App Store deployment with premium features
